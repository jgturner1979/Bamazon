The Bamazon Store

This project asked to create a store that a customer could access to purchase items stored in a mySQL database.

The customer functionality allows a customer through the CLI to pick from a list of availablity products in inventory.  If the customer request an order amount that is over the available inventory, then they will receive a prompt stating insufficient quantity.  Then will be prompted to continue shopping. As the customer places orders, the price times the quantity of the item will be placed in a "shopping cart" and the amount due at checkout will be displayed.  When the customer answers "n" to the continue shopping questions, they will be logged out of the store.

See the customer portal video below.

The manager functionality allows the manager to go in a view current stock inventory of all products available.  They can seach for low inventory items which is set at quantity 500.  They can add inventory to the current inventory levels and they can add new products which pushes the information to the mySQL database.
